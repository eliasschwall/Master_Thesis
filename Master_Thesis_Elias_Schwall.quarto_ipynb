        "\n",
        "Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are notable for their self-renewal capabilities and pluripotency, allowing them to differentiate into any cell type from the three germ layers. While this differentiation process is limited in vivo, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) cultivated in vitro can self-renew indefinitely under specific culture conditions [@nicholsNaivePrimedPluripotent2009]. One such condition is the 2i+LIF (two inhibitors with leukemia inhibitory factor) medium, which maintains the naive pluripotent state of ESCs, closely mimicking the inner cell mass of pre-implantation mouse embryos.\n",
