They are best known as inducible transcriptional regulators of genes encoding molecular chaperones and other stress proteins. Four members of the HSF family are also important for normal development and lifespan-enhancing pathways, and the repertoire of HSF targets has thus expanded well beyond the heat shock genes. These unexpected observations have uncovered complex layers of post-translational regulation of HSFs that integrate the metabolic state of the cell with stress biology, and in doing so control fundamental aspects of the health of the proteome and ageing.},

Here, we present decoupleR, a Bioconductor and Python package containing computational methods to extract these activities within a unified framework. decoupleR allows us to flexibly run any method with a given resource, including methods that leverage mode of regulation and weights of interactions, which are not present in other frameworks. Moreover, it leverages OmniPath, a meta-resource comprising over 100 databases of prior knowledge. Using decoupleR, we evaluated the performance of methods on transcriptomic and phospho-proteomic perturbation experiments. Our findings suggest that simple linear models and the consensus score across top methods perform better than other methods at predicting perturbed regulators.decoupleR's open-source code is available in Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/decoupleR.html) for R and in GitHub (https://github.com/saezlab/decoupler-py) for Python.

Here, we show that, in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), H3.3 is required for proper establishment of H3K27me3 at the promoters of developmentally regulated genes. Upon H3.3 depletion, these promoters show reduced nucleosome turnover measured by deposition of de novo synthesized histones and reduced PRC2 occupancy. Further, we show H3.3-dependent interaction of PRC2 with the histone chaperone, Hira, and that Hira localization to chromatin requires H3.3. Our data demonstrate the importance of H3.3 in maintaining a chromatin landscape in ESCs that is important for proper gene regulation during differentiation. Moreover, our findings support the emerging notion that H3.3 has multiple functions in distinct genomic locations~that are not always correlated with an "active" chromatin state.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.}

We present transcriptional and functional data to identify the embryonic counterpart of ESCs. Marker profiling shows that ESCs are distinct from early inner cell mass (ICM) and closely resemble pre-implantation epiblast. A characteristic feature of mouse ESCs is propagation without ERK signalling. Single-cell culture reveals that cell-autonomous capacity to thrive when the ERK pathway is inhibited arises late during blastocyst development and is lost after implantation. The frequency of deriving clonal ESC lines suggests that all E4.5 epiblast cells can become ESCs. We further show that ICM cells from early blastocysts can progress to ERK independence if provided with a specific laminin substrate. These findings suggest that formation of the epiblast coincides with competence for ERK-independent self-renewal in vitro and consequent propagation as ESC lines.},

However, the transcriptional regulation of NANOG itself in hESCs has largely been elusive. We established a NANOG promoter luciferase reporter assay as a fast read-out for indicating the pluripotent status of hESCs. From the functional cDNA screens and NANOG promoter characterization, we successfully identified a zinc finger transcription factor KLF4 and a homeodomain transcription factor PBX1 as two novel transcriptional regulators that maintain the pluripotent and undifferentiated state of hESCs. We showed that both KLF4 and PBX1 mRNA and protein expression were downregulated during hESC differentiation. In addition, overexpression of KLF4 and PBX1 upregulated NANOG promoter activity and also the endogenous NANOG protein expression in hESCs. Direct binding of KLF4 on NANOG proximal promoter and PBX1 on a new upstream enhancer and proximal promoter were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Knockdown of KLF4/PBX1 or mutation of KLF4/PBX1 binding motifs significantly downregulated NANOG promoter activity. We also showed that specific members of the SP/KLF and PBX family are functionally redundant at the NANOG promoter and that KLF4 and PBX1 cooperated with OCT4 and SOX2, and transactivated synergistically the NANOG promoter activity. Our results show two novel upstream transcription activators of NANOG that are functionally important for the self-renewal of hESC and provide new insights into the expanded regulatory circuitry that maintains hESC pluripotency.},

Its contribution to the development of several organs has been elucidated mainly through the study of murine knockout models. A crucial role for human development has been recently highlighted through the discovery of different de novo pathogenic PBX1 variants in children affected by developmental defects. In the adult, PBX1 is expressed in selected tissues such as in the brain, in the gastro-intestinal and urinary systems, or in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, while in other organs is barely detectable. When involved in the t(1;19) chromosomal translocation it acts as an oncogene, since the resulting fusion protein drives pre-B cell leukemia, due to the induction of target genes not normally targeted by the native protein. Its aberrant expression has been associated to tumor development, progression, or therapy-resistance as in breast cancer, ovarian cancer or myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). On the other hand, in colorectal cancer PBX1 functions as a tumor suppressor, highlighting its context-dependent role. We here discuss differences and analogies of PBX1 roles during embryonic development and in cancer, focusing mainly on the most recent discoveries.},

Oocytes were lysed and thoroughly dispersed in the presence of 1\% DOC, and centrifuged on sucrose gradients to separate polysomes from smaller components not engaged in translation. After the short chase, one-third of the labeled ribosomes appeared in EDTA-sensitive polysomes. The proportion of ribosomes in both fractions remained stable during the long chase, demonstrating no net flow from one fraction to the other. When gradient fractions were analyzed by poly(U) Sepharose chromatography, it was found that about 20\% of the labeled poly(A)+ RNA appeared in polysomes after the short chase. The half-lives of stored and translated mRNA were followed relative to stable rRNA during the long chase. Stored mRNA was completely stable, but translated mRNA turned over with a t12 of about 6 days. Other methods for separating stored from translated components were not successful, including sedimentation of putative large complexes (fibrillar lattices) containing stored components, or chromatography of lysates on oligo(dT)-cellulose. Results presented here combined with our previous results demonstrate that, during meiotic maturation, the percent of labeled stable RNA which is polyadenylated declines from 19 to 10\%, suggesting deadenylation or degradation of half of the accumulated maternal mRNA.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases., Results: To align our large ({$>$}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {$>$}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 {\texttimes} 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80--90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy., Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

The remarkable diversity of RBPs, which appears to have increased during evolution in parallel to the increase in the number of introns, allows eukaryotic cells to utilize them in an enormous array of combinations giving rise to a unique RNP for each RNA.

  abstract = {Translation is the final step in the flow of the genetic information, and regulation at this level allows an immediate, rapid and reversible response to changes in physiological conditions. This type of regulation is especially advantageous during conditions of cellular stress. Translation is divided into three distinct phases: initiation, elongation and termination. Although all three phases are subject to regulatory mechanisms, under most circumstances the rate-limiting, regulated step is the initiation of translation. Most cellular mRNAs are translated by a cap-dependent mechanism that involves the interaction of the 5{$\prime$} m7G-cap structure of the mRNA with the cap-binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF4E), and the translation-initiation machinery. Some viral and cellular mRNAs have evolved a cap-independent mechanism of translation initiation that uses the internal ribosome-entry site (IRES) sequence that is located in the 5{$\prime$} untranslated regions of these mRNAs. IRESs recruit ribosomes directly to the vicinity of the initiation codon without the requirement for eIF4E. Global translation is reduced in response to most cellular stresses, both to conserve energy and to prevent the synthesis of unwanted proteins. Remarkably, the stress-induced attenuation of global translation is often accompanied by a switch to the selective translation of proteins that are required for cell survival under stress. Several genes that are involved in cell growth and proliferation, differentiation and the regulation of apoptosis use IRES-mediated translation. This mode of translation provides a means for escaping the global decline in protein synthesis, and allows the selective translation of specific mRNAs, which indicates that the selective regulation of IRES-mediated translation is crucial to the regulation of cell death and survival.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress the expression of mRNA targets by promoting translational repression and mRNA degradation.In animals, target degradation is initiated by accelerated deadenylation, which is normally followed by decapping and subsequent degradation of the mRNA body. However, some deadenylated targets may not be further degraded.In plants, target degradation is initiated by endonucleolytic cleavage catalysed by the Argonaute proteins.Although translational repression and mRNA degradation have both been reported in animals and plants, recent evidence indicates that target degradation provides a major contribution to silencing in both kingdoms.An important difference between the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated silencing in animals and plants is the requirement, in animals, for proteins of the GW182 family.GW182 proteins are essential for silencing in animal cells. They interact with Argonaute proteins through an amino-terminal domain and with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) through a carboxy-terminal silencing domain.Current models suggest that GW182 proteins interfere with PABPC function in translation and/or mRNA stabilization and promote mRNA deadenylation.A remaining open question is whether silencing of miRNA targets can be entirely attributed to deadenylation or whether additional mechanisms are involved in repressing protein production.Moreover, the contribution of translational repression to silencing in plants remains unknown.},

  abstract = {Alternative splicing of cardiac troponin T (cTNT) exon 5 undergoes a developmentally regulated switch such that exon inclusion predominates in embryonic, but not adult, striated muscle. We previously described four muscle-specific splicing enhancers (MSEs) within introns flanking exon 5 in chicken cTNT that are both necessary and sufficient for exon inclusion in embryonic muscle. We also demonstrated that CUG-binding protein (CUG-BP) binds a conserved CUG motif within a human cTNT MSE and positively regulates MSE-dependent exon inclusion. Here we report that CUG-BP is one of a novel family of developmentally regulated RNA binding proteins that includes embryonically lethal abnormal vision-type RNA binding protein 3 (ETR-3). This family, which we call CELF proteins for CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factors, specifically bound MSE-containing RNAs in vitro and activated MSE-dependent exon inclusion of cTNT minigenes in vivo. The expression of two CELF proteins is highly restricted to brain. CUG-BP, ETR-3, and CELF4 are more broadly expressed, and expression is developmentally regulated in striated muscle and brain. Changes in the level of expression and isoforms of ETR-3 in two different developmental systems correlated with regulated changes in cTNT splicing. A switch from cTNT exon skipping to inclusion tightly correlated with induction of ETR-3 protein expression during differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. During heart development, the switch in cTNT splicing correlated with a transition in ETR-3 protein isoforms. We propose that ETR-3 is a major regulator of cTNT alternative splicing and that the CELF family plays an important regulatory role in cell-specific alternative splicing during normal development and disease.},

The mechanisms underlying the regulation of ERK1 and ERK2, their mode of action and their impact on the development and homeostasis of various organisms have been the focus of much attention for nearly three decades. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of this important class of kinases. We begin with a brief overview of the structure, regulation, substrate recognition and subcellular localization of ERK1 and ERK2. We then systematically discuss how ERK signalling regulates six fundamental cellular processes in response to extracellular cues. These processes are cell proliferation, cell survival, cell growth, cell metabolism, cell migration and cell differentiation.},

Nrf2 has been shown to be dispensable for growth and development in mice. Nrf2-deficient mice, however, are impaired in oxidative stress defense. We previously showed that loss of Nrf1 function in mice results late gestational embryonic lethality. To determine whether Nrf1 and Nrf2 have overlapping functions during early development and in the oxidative stress response, we generated mice that are deficient in both Nrf1 and Nrf2. In contrast to the late embryonic lethality in Nrf1 mutants, compound Nrf1, Nrf2 mutants die early between embryonic days 9 and 10 and exhibit extensive apoptosis that is not observed in the single mutants. Loss of Nrf1 and Nrf2 leads to marked oxidative stress in cells that is indicated by elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and cell death that is reversed by culturing under reduced oxygen tension or the addition of antioxidants. Compound mutant cells also show increased levels of p53 and induction of Noxa, a death effector p53 target gene, suggesting that cell death is potentially mediated by reactive oxygen species activation of p53. Moreover, we show that expression of genes related to antioxidant defense is severely impaired in compound mutant cells compared with single mutant cells. Together, these findings indicate that the functions of Nrf1 and Nrf2 overlap during early development and to a large extent in regulating antioxidant gene expression in cells.},

By arranging the domains in various ways, these proteins can satisfy the diverse biological roles they play.The modular nature of RNA-binding proteins allows them to satisfy their functional roles in various ways. Multiple domains allow the recognition of long sequence stretches, sequences that are separated from each other or even sequences on different RNAs. The domains can pre-organize themselves to arrange the RNA in a particular topology or, conversely, the proteins can be arranged to interact with a particular RNA structure. Last, enzymatic domains can be combined with RNA-binding domains to regulate catalytic activity.One of the most common arrangements is to have two domains separated by a short linker. This allows the protein to create a larger interaction surface that can interact with many more nucleotides than the isolated domains.Interdomain linkers often have key functional roles in organizing the domains to facilitate the recognition of a particular substrate.Many of the RNA-binding modules can participate in protein--protein interactions, which can facilitate assembly of higher-order complexes.RNA-binding modules can be combined with enzymatic domains to properly position the catalytic domain on the RNA or to regulate the activity of the enzyme.},

  abstract = {Mammalian cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms for translational control, most of which are sensitive to nutrient availability, cellular energy, stress, hormones and growth factor stimuli.A key pathway that integrates and responds to environmental cues involves the target of rapamycin (TOR). In mammals, the form of TOR that directly regulates protein synthesis is mammalian TOR complex 1 (mTORC1).Growth factors or related hormones activate several key signal transduction pathways. In particular, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)--AKT pathway and the Ras--ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway stimulate mTORC1 signalling by inhibiting the tumour suppressor complex tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)--TSC2, a negative regulator of mTORC1.AMP-activated protein kinase is the energy sensor for mTORC1, whereas the Rag family of small GTPases mediate amino acid signalling to mTORC1.mTORC1 signalling regulates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), eIF4B and 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), as well as the 40S ribosomal S6 kinases (S6Ks), including S6K1 and S6K2.Some mRNA species contain inhibitory secondary structures in the 5{$\prime$} untranslated region, which prevents efficient scanning of the small ribosome subunit to the start codon. The initiation factor eIF4A is an RNA helicase that is capable of unwinding mRNA secondary structures; the helicase activity can be modulated by S6K1.The multisubunit initiation factor complex eIF3 functions as a dynamic scaffold for mTORC1 and S6K1 binding, and the scaffold protein SKAR recruits activated S6K1 to newly generated mRNAs.},

A relevant effect of 2i is the inhibition of Cdk8/19, which are negative regulators of the Mediator complex, responsible for the activity of enhancers. Inhibition of Cdk8/19 (Cdk8/19i) stimulates enhancers and, similar to 2i, stabilizes ESCs in the na{\"i}ve state. Here, we use mass spectrometry to describe the molecular events (phosphoproteome, proteome, and metabolome) triggered by 2i and Cdk8/19i on ESCs. Our data reveal widespread commonalities between these two treatments, suggesting overlapping processes. We find that post-transcriptional de-repression by both 2i and Cdk8/19i might support the mitochondrial capacity of naive cells. However, proteome reprogramming in each treatment is achieved by different mechanisms. Cdk8/19i acts directly on the transcriptional machinery, activating key identity genes to promote the na{\"i}ve program. In contrast, 2i stabilizes the na{\"i}ve circuitry through, in part, de-phosphorylation of downstream transcriptional effectors.},

Here we show that the introduction of let-7 miRNAs---a family of miRNAs highly expressed in somatic cells---can suppress self-renewal in Dgcr8-/- but not wild-type ESCs. Introduction of ESC cell cycle regulating (ESCC) miRNAs into the Dgcr8-/- ESCs blocks the capacity of let-7 to suppress self-renewal. Profiling and bioinformatic analyses show that let-7 inhibits whereas ESCC miRNAs indirectly activate numerous self-renewal genes. Furthermore, inhibition of the let-7 family promotes de-differentiation of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells. Together, these findings show how the ESCC and let-7 miRNAs act through common pathways to alternatively stabilize the self-renewing versus differentiated cell fates.},

  abstract = {The spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression in neurons is an important step in creating functional and structural neuronal networks. The complexity of neurons require differential expression of various proteins in different compartments. Highly polarised cells, such as neurons, respond rapidly to different external stimuli by changing their local protein abundance and composition. Neurons can have extensions up to a meter away from their cell body in humans, so it is easy to envisage why they need to manage the synthesis of new proteins locally and on-demand. Recent research has demonstrated that neurons can control the expression of different proteins by localising translationally silent mRNAs, followed by subsequent translation. Neurons use mRNA localization and local translation to achieve different purposes during their life cycle. While developing neurons rely on mRNA localization for axon guidance and synaptogenesis, mature neurons can use mRNA localization for maintenance of essential physiological processes. mRNA localization also plays a role in response to neuron injury to regenerate and restore neuronal connections. Recent microscopic imaging techniques such as live imaging of fluorescently tagged molecules combined with genetic and biochemical studies in neurons have illustrated evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for targeting mRNAs into their correct compartments. This review provides an overview of mRNA localization and local translation in vertebrate and invertebrate neurons and discusses the mechanism by which mRNAs are trafficked into axons. Furthermore, the role of mRNA localization in synaptic activation, as well as axonal injury is explored.},

These include the ability of p53 to induce cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence and apoptosis. In addition, during the 30 years of p53 research, numerous studies have implicated p53 in the regulation of differentiation and developmental pathways. Here, we summarize the data on these relatively less-characterized functions of p53, including its involvement in embryogenesis and various differentiation programs, as well as its function in restraining de-differentiation of mature somatic cells. Besides the well-known functions of p53 as a cell-cycle regulator and a mediator of apoptosis, both coincide with differentiation processes, p53 was shown to exert its effects on various differentiation programs via direct regulation of specific key factors controlling these programs. The complex regulation by p53, which acts to suppress or to induce differentiation, is mainly the result of the specific cell type and fate.

This conclusion is further supporting the notion that aberrant differentiation is associated with malignant transformation.},

  abstract = {GENCODE produces comprehensive reference gene annotation for human and mouse. Entering its twentieth year, the project remains highly active as new technologies and methodologies allow us to catalog the genome at ever-increasing granularity. In particular, long-read transcriptome sequencing enables us to identify large numbers of missing transcripts and to substantially improve existing models, and our long non-coding RNA catalogs have undergone a dramatic expansion and reconfiguration as a result. Meanwhile, we are incorporating data from state-of-the-art proteomics and Ribo-seq experiments to fine-tune our annotation of translated sequences, while further insights into function can be gained from multi-genome alignments that grow richer as more species' genomes are sequenced. Such methodologies are combined into a fully integrated annotation workflow. However, the increasing complexity of our resources can present usability challenges, and we are resolving these with the creation of filtered genesets such as MANE Select and GENCODE Primary. The next challenge is to propagate annotations throughout multiple human and mouse genomes, as we enter the pangenome era. Our resources are freely available at our web portal www.gencodegenes.org, and via the Ensembl and UCSC genome browsers.},

The regulatory relationship between transcription factors (TFs), key regulators of gene expression, and their target genes, the so called TF regulons, can be coupled with computational algorithms to estimate the activity of TFs. However, to interpret these findings accurately, regulons of high reliability and coverage are needed. In this study, we present and evaluate a collection of regulons created using the CollecTRI meta-resource containing signed TF--gene interactions for 1186 TFs. In this context, we introduce a workflow to integrate information from multiple resources and assign the sign of regulation to TF--gene interactions that could be applied to other comprehensive knowledge bases. We find that the signed CollecTRI-derived regulons outperform other public collections of regulatory interactions in accurately inferring changes in TF activities in perturbation experiments. Furthermore, we showcase the value of the regulons by examining TF activity profiles in three different cancer types and exploring TF activities at the level of single-cells. Overall, the CollecTRI-derived TF regulons enable the accurate and comprehensive estimation of TF activities and thereby help to interpret transcriptomics data.},

This was first recognized through functional biochemical experiments, and in the past decade, major technological advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the study of protein phosphorylation on a global scale. This rapidly growing field of phosphoproteomics has revealed that more than 100,000 distinct phosphorylation events occur in human cells, which likely affect the function of every protein. Phosphoproteomics has improved the understanding of the function of even the most well-characterized protein kinases by revealing new downstream substrates and biology. However, current biochemical and bioinformatic approaches have only identified kinases for less than 5\% of the phosphoproteome, and functional assignments of phosphosites are almost negligible. Notably, our understanding of the relationship between kinases and their substrates follows a power law distribution, with almost 90\% of phosphorylation sites currently assigned to the top 20\% of kinases. In addition, more than 150 kinases do not have a single known substrate. Despite a small group of kinases dominating biomedical research, the number of substrates assigned to a kinase does not correlate with disease relevance as determined by pathogenic human mutation prevalence and mouse model phenotypes. Improving our understanding of the substrates targeted by all kinases and functionally annotating the phosphoproteome will be broadly beneficial. Advances in phosphoproteomics technologies, combined with functional screening approaches, should make it feasible to illuminate the connectivity and functionality of the entire phosphoproteome, providing enormous opportunities for discovering new biology, therapeutic targets, and possibly diagnostics.},

For example, the same genetic program, comprising sequential changes in transcriptional states, governs the differentiation of motor neurons in mouse and human, but the tempo at which it operates differs between species. Using in vitro directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells to motor neurons, we show that the program runs more than twice as fast in mouse as in human. This is not due to differences in signaling, nor the genomic sequence of genes or their regulatory elements. Instead, there is an approximately two-fold increase in protein stability and cell cycle duration in human cells compared to mouse. This can account for the slower pace of human development and suggests that differences in protein turnover play a role in interspecies differences in developmental tempo.},

Both pathways engage the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) to regulate a variety of components of the translational machinery. While these pathways regulate protein synthesis in homeostasis, their dysregulation results in aberrant translation leading to human diseases, including diabetes, neurological disorders, and cancer.

The dynamic balance of calcium between auditory hair cells and the fluid they bathe in enables us to hear our first sound, and our interpretation and response to this sound requires rapid calcium flux through neuronal voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Calcium signaling can decode and integrate informational cues from both the chemical and mechanical cellular microenvironment to drive the form and function of many mammalian organ-systems. Here, we highlight roles for the intracellular calcium signal in the reproductive- and developmental- biology of mammals. A greater appreciation of the signaling pathways that initiate and support life has wide-ranging significance for the fields of reproductive science, neonatology and regenerative medicine.

After phosphorylation by ERK, conformation of XPO5 is altered by prolyl isomerase Pin1, resulting in reduction of pre-miRNA loading. In liver cancer, the ERK-mediated XPO5 suppression reduces miR-122, increases microtubule dynamics, and results in tumor development and drug resistance. Analysis of clinical specimens further showed that XPO5 phosphorylation is associated with poor prognosis for liver cancer patients. Our study reveals a function of ERK in miRNA biogenesis and suggests that modulation of miRNA export has potential clinical implications.},

  abstract = {Translational control of gene expression has emerged as a key mechanism in regulating different forms of long-lasting neuronal plasticity. Maladaptive plastic reorganization of peripheral and spinal nociceptive circuits underlies many chronic pain states and relies on new gene expression. Accordingly, downregulation of mRNA translation in primary afferents and spinal cord neurons inhibits tissue injury-induced sensitization of nociceptive pathways, supporting a central role for translation dysregulation in the development of persistent pain. Translation is primarily regulated at the initiation stage via the coordinated activity of translation initiation factors. The mRNA cap-binding protein, eIF4E, is involved in the recruitment of the ribosome to the mRNA cap structure, playing a central role in the regulation of translation initiation. eIF4E integrates inputs from the mTOR and ERK signaling pathways, both of which are activated in numerous painful conditions to regulate the translation of a subset of mRNAs. Many of these mRNAs are involved in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and neuroplasticity. However, the full repertoire of eIF4E-dependent mRNAs in the nervous system and their translation regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this review, we summarize the current evidence for the role of eIF4E-dependent translational control in the sensitization of pain circuits and present pharmacological approaches to target these mechanisms. The understanding eIF4E-dependent translational control mechanisms and their roles in aberrant plasticity of nociceptive circuits might reveal novel therapeutic targets to treat persistent pain states.},

  abstract = {Pluripotency is highly dynamic and progresses through a continuum of pluripotent stem cell states. The two states that bookend the pluripotency continuum, naive and primed, are well characterized, but our understanding of the intermediate states and transitions between them remains incomplete. Here, we dissect the dynamics of pluripotent state transitions underlying pre- to post-implantation epiblast differentiation. Through comprehensive mapping of the proteome, phosphoproteome, transcriptome, and epigenome of embryonic stem cells transitioning from naive to primed pluripotency, we find that rapid, acute, and widespread changes to the phosphoproteome precede ordered changes to the epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Reconstruction of the kinase-substrate networks reveals signaling cascades, dynamics, and crosstalk. Distinct waves of global proteomic changes mark discrete phases of pluripotency, with cell-state-specific surface markers tracking pluripotent state transitions. Our data provide new insights into multi-layered control of the phased progression of pluripotency and a foundation for modeling mechanisms regulating pluripotent state transitions (www.stemcellatlas.org).},

  abstract = {Embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal has generally been viewed as being dependent on the stimulation of various transcriptional pathways by exogenous factors in the culture media. A new study of mouse ES cells in a variety of cell culture condtions shows that, in fact, ES cell self-renewal does not rely on extrinsic instruction, and can be enabled by the elimination of factors that induce differentiation, and by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3. This suggests that the ground state of the ES cell in the absence of extrinsic instruction is self-renewal --- a display of self sufficiency that is more like that of a unicellular organism than the interdependence we expect of regular metazoan cells.},

  abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}) plays important roles in processes such as immunomodulation, fever, inflammatory response, inhibition of tumor formation, and inhibition of viral replication. TNF-{$\alpha$} and its receptors are ubiquitously expressed in developing organs and they regulate the survival, proliferation, and apoptosis of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and progenitor cells. TNF-{$\alpha$} is an important inflammatory factor that also regulates the inflammatory response during organogenesis, and its cytotoxic effects can interfere with normal developmental processes, even leading to the onset of diseases. This review summarizes the various roles of TNF-{$\alpha$} in organogenesis in terms of its secreting pattern, concentration-dependent activities, and interactions with other signaling pathways. We also explored new potential functions of TNF-{$\alpha$}.},

  abstract = {The NOTCH gene was identified approximately 110 years ago. Classical studies have revealed that NOTCH signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway. NOTCH receptors undergo three cleavages and translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes. NOTCH signaling deeply participates in the development and homeostasis of multiple tissues and organs, the aberration of which results in cancerous and noncancerous diseases. However, recent studies indicate that the outcomes of NOTCH signaling are changeable and highly dependent on context. In terms of cancers, NOTCH signaling can both promote and inhibit tumor development in various types of cancer. The overall performance of NOTCH-targeted therapies in clinical trials has failed to meet expectations. Additionally, NOTCH mutation has been proposed as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade therapy in many cancers. Collectively, the NOTCH pathway needs to be integrally assessed with new perspectives to inspire discoveries and applications. In this review, we focus on both classical and the latest findings related to NOTCH signaling to illustrate the history, architecture, regulatory mechanisms, contributions to physiological development, related diseases, and therapeutic applications of the NOTCH pathway. The contributions of NOTCH signaling to the tumor immune microenvironment and cancer immunotherapy are also highlighted. We hope this review will help not only beginners but also experts to systematically and thoroughly understand the NOTCH signaling pathway.},
