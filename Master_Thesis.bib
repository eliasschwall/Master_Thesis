  abstract = {The precise relationship of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to cells in the mouse embryo remains controversial. We present transcriptional and functional data to identify the embryonic counterpart of ESCs. Marker profiling shows that ESCs are distinct from early inner cell mass (ICM) and closely resemble pre-implantation epiblast. A characteristic feature of mouse ESCs is propagation without ERK signalling. Single-cell culture reveals that cell-autonomous capacity to thrive when the ERK pathway is inhibited arises late during blastocyst development and is lost after implantation. The frequency of deriving clonal ESC lines suggests that all E4.5 epiblast cells can become ESCs. We further show that ICM cells from early blastocysts can progress to ERK independence if provided with a specific laminin substrate. These findings suggest that formation of the epiblast coincides with competence for ERK-independent self-renewal in vitro and consequent propagation as ESC lines.},

Oocytes were lysed and thoroughly dispersed in the presence of 1\% DOC, and centrifuged on sucrose gradients to separate polysomes from smaller components not engaged in translation. After the short chase, one-third of the labeled ribosomes appeared in EDTA-sensitive polysomes. The proportion of ribosomes in both fractions remained stable during the long chase, demonstrating no net flow from one fraction to the other. When gradient fractions were analyzed by poly(U) Sepharose chromatography, it was found that about 20\% of the labeled poly(A)+ RNA appeared in polysomes after the short chase. The half-lives of stored and translated mRNA were followed relative to stable rRNA during the long chase. Stored mRNA was completely stable, but translated mRNA turned over with a t12 of about 6 days. Other methods for separating stored from translated components were not successful, including sedimentation of putative large complexes (fibrillar lattices) containing stored components, or chromatography of lysates on oligo(dT)-cellulose. Results presented here combined with our previous results demonstrate that, during meiotic maturation, the percent of labeled stable RNA which is polyadenylated declines from 19 to 10\%, suggesting deadenylation or degradation of half of the accumulated maternal mRNA.},

  abstract = {Translation is the final step in the flow of the genetic information, and regulation at this level allows an immediate, rapid and reversible response to changes in physiological conditions. This type of regulation is especially advantageous during conditions of cellular stress. Translation is divided into three distinct phases: initiation, elongation and termination. Although all three phases are subject to regulatory mechanisms, under most circumstances the rate-limiting, regulated step is the initiation of translation. Most cellular mRNAs are translated by a cap-dependent mechanism that involves the interaction of the 5{$\prime$} m7G-cap structure of the mRNA with the cap-binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF4E), and the translation-initiation machinery. Some viral and cellular mRNAs have evolved a cap-independent mechanism of translation initiation that uses the internal ribosome-entry site (IRES) sequence that is located in the 5{$\prime$} untranslated regions of these mRNAs. IRESs recruit ribosomes directly to the vicinity of the initiation codon without the requirement for eIF4E. Global translation is reduced in response to most cellular stresses, both to conserve energy and to prevent the synthesis of unwanted proteins. Remarkably, the stress-induced attenuation of global translation is often accompanied by a switch to the selective translation of proteins that are required for cell survival under stress. Several genes that are involved in cell growth and proliferation, differentiation and the regulation of apoptosis use IRES-mediated translation. This mode of translation provides a means for escaping the global decline in protein synthesis, and allows the selective translation of specific mRNAs, which indicates that the selective regulation of IRES-mediated translation is crucial to the regulation of cell death and survival.},

By phosphorylating widely diverse substrates, ERK proteins govern a variety of evolutionarily conserved cellular processes in metazoans, the dysregulation of which contributes to the cause of distinct human diseases. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of ERK1 and ERK2, their mode of action and their impact on the development and homeostasis of various organisms have been the focus of much attention for nearly three decades. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of this important class of kinases. We begin with a brief overview of the structure, regulation, substrate recognition and subcellular localization of ERK1 and ERK2. We then systematically discuss how ERK signalling regulates six fundamental cellular processes in response to extracellular cues. These processes are cell proliferation, cell survival, cell growth, cell metabolism, cell migration and cell differentiation.},

A relevant effect of 2i is the inhibition of Cdk8/19, which are negative regulators of the Mediator complex, responsible for the activity of enhancers. Inhibition of Cdk8/19 (Cdk8/19i) stimulates enhancers and, similar to 2i, stabilizes ESCs in the na{\"i}ve state. Here, we use mass spectrometry to describe the molecular events (phosphoproteome, proteome, and metabolome) triggered by 2i and Cdk8/19i on ESCs. Our data reveal widespread commonalities between these two treatments, suggesting overlapping processes. We find that post-transcriptional de-repression by both 2i and Cdk8/19i might support the mitochondrial capacity of naive cells. However, proteome reprogramming in each treatment is achieved by different mechanisms. Cdk8/19i acts directly on the transcriptional machinery, activating key identity genes to promote the na{\"i}ve program. In contrast, 2i stabilizes the na{\"i}ve circuitry through, in part, de-phosphorylation of downstream transcriptional effectors.},

The complexity of neurons require differential expression of various proteins in different compartments. Highly polarised cells, such as neurons, respond rapidly to different external stimuli by changing their local protein abundance and composition. Neurons can have extensions up to a meter away from their cell body in humans, so it is easy to envisage why they need to manage the synthesis of new proteins locally and on-demand. Recent research has demonstrated that neurons can control the expression of different proteins by localising translationally silent mRNAs, followed by subsequent translation. Neurons use mRNA localization and local translation to achieve different purposes during their life cycle. While developing neurons rely on mRNA localization for axon guidance and synaptogenesis, mature neurons can use mRNA localization for maintenance of essential physiological processes. mRNA localization also plays a role in response to neuron injury to regenerate and restore neuronal connections. Recent microscopic imaging techniques such as live imaging of fluorescently tagged molecules combined with genetic and biochemical studies in neurons have illustrated evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for targeting mRNAs into their correct compartments. This review provides an overview of mRNA localization and local translation in vertebrate and invertebrate neurons and discusses the mechanism by which mRNAs are trafficked into axons. Furthermore, the role of mRNA localization in synaptic activation, as well as axonal injury is explored.},

  abstract = {Protein phosphorylation is a major regulator of protein function and biological outcomes. This was first recognized through functional biochemical experiments, and in the past decade, major technological advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the study of protein phosphorylation on a global scale. This rapidly growing field of phosphoproteomics has revealed that more than 100,000 distinct phosphorylation events occur in human cells, which likely affect the function of every protein. Phosphoproteomics has improved the understanding of the function of even the most well-characterized protein kinases by revealing new downstream substrates and biology. However, current biochemical and bioinformatic approaches have only identified kinases for less than 5\% of the phosphoproteome, and functional assignments of phosphosites are almost negligible. Notably, our understanding of the relationship between kinases and their substrates follows a power law distribution, with almost 90\% of phosphorylation sites currently assigned to the top 20\% of kinases. In addition, more than 150 kinases do not have a single known substrate. Despite a small group of kinases dominating biomedical research, the number of substrates assigned to a kinase does not correlate with disease relevance as determined by pathogenic human mutation prevalence and mouse model phenotypes. Improving our understanding of the substrates targeted by all kinases and functionally annotating the phosphoproteome will be broadly beneficial. Advances in phosphoproteomics technologies, combined with functional screening approaches, should make it feasible to illuminate the connectivity and functionality of the entire phosphoproteome, providing enormous opportunities for discovering new biology, therapeutic targets, and possibly diagnostics.},

For example, the same genetic program, comprising sequential changes in transcriptional states, governs the differentiation of motor neurons in mouse and human, but the tempo at which it operates differs between species. Using in vitro directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells to motor neurons, we show that the program runs more than twice as fast in mouse as in human. This is not due to differences in signaling, nor the genomic sequence of genes or their regulatory elements. Instead, there is an approximately two-fold increase in protein stability and cell cycle duration in human cells compared to mouse. This can account for the slower pace of human development and suggests that differences in protein turnover play a role in interspecies differences in developmental tempo.},

  abstract = {Translational control of gene expression has emerged as a key mechanism in regulating different forms of long-lasting neuronal plasticity. Maladaptive plastic reorganization of peripheral and spinal nociceptive circuits underlies many chronic pain states and relies on new gene expression. Accordingly, downregulation of mRNA translation in primary afferents and spinal cord neurons inhibits tissue injury-induced sensitization of nociceptive pathways, supporting a central role for translation dysregulation in the development of persistent pain. Translation is primarily regulated at the initiation stage via the coordinated activity of translation initiation factors. The mRNA cap-binding protein, eIF4E, is involved in the recruitment of the ribosome to the mRNA cap structure, playing a central role in the regulation of translation initiation. eIF4E integrates inputs from the mTOR and ERK signaling pathways, both of which are activated in numerous painful conditions to regulate the translation of a subset of mRNAs. Many of these mRNAs are involved in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and neuroplasticity. However, the full repertoire of eIF4E-dependent mRNAs in the nervous system and their translation regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this review, we summarize the current evidence for the role of eIF4E-dependent translational control in the sensitization of pain circuits and present pharmacological approaches to target these mechanisms. The understanding eIF4E-dependent translational control mechanisms and their roles in aberrant plasticity of nociceptive circuits might reveal novel therapeutic targets to treat persistent pain states.},

The two states that bookend the pluripotency continuum, naive and primed, are well characterized, but our understanding of the intermediate states and transitions between them remains incomplete. Here, we dissect the dynamics of pluripotent state transitions underlying pre- to post-implantation epiblast differentiation. Through comprehensive mapping of the proteome, phosphoproteome, transcriptome, and epigenome of embryonic stem cells transitioning from naive to primed pluripotency, we find that rapid, acute, and widespread changes to the phosphoproteome precede ordered changes to the epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Reconstruction of the kinase-substrate networks reveals signaling cascades, dynamics, and crosstalk. Distinct waves of global proteomic changes mark discrete phases of pluripotency, with cell-state-specific surface markers tracking pluripotent state transitions. Our data provide new insights into multi-layered control of the phased progression of pluripotency and a foundation for modeling mechanisms regulating pluripotent state transitions (www.stemcellatlas.org).},
